# Mathematical
=============

A simple, responsive web framework. Highly readable on large and small screens. 
Consider it a series of smart defaults for headers and body copy. 

## Lightweight
Mathematical is light-weight. REALLY light-weight. Uncompressed CSS weighs in at a hefty 920 bytes. 
Minified version is 620 bytes. 

## How to Use
Include mathematical-type.css early on. Override if needed. Will work out of the box.
